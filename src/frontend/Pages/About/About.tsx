        "Every campus bus (routes 120–126, plus the football shuttle on game days), and any Metro Transit bus or light rail line. Campus bus locations refresh every couple of seconds and Metro every few seconds. Buses whose location hasn't updated in over two minutes are faded out."],
    ["How do I add a route that isn't in the menu?",
        "Open the route menu (☰) and type the route number into \"Add a route\" at the bottom."],
    ["How do I find stops near me?",
        "Tap \"Stops near me\" for the closest stops, when the next buses leave, and how long the walk is. Tap the star on a stop to keep it at the top of that list, or the bell next to a departure to get a notification 5 minutes before it leaves."],
    ["What does tapping a bus show?",
        "Its route, direction, next stop and when it gets there, whether it's running late, and its bus number. Campus buses also show how full they are."],
    ["How does place search work?",
        "Search for a building or address to drop a pin there and show the stops around it. Tap any stop for its upcoming departures."],
    ["Can I put it on my home screen?",
        "Yes. In Safari tap Share → Add to Home Screen, or in Chrome tap ⋮ → Add to Home screen. It opens like an app."],

                    The campus buses are free, and students who pay the Transportation and Safety Fee get
